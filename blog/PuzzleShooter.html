        <article class="blog-card">
            <h2>Configuring the Client (Unreal Engine)</h2>
            <p>The client makes http requests to the REST API, which has various resources for various AWS Lambda
                functions. The client uses a combination of the responses returned from the API to join an Unreal Engine
                game server process hosted on an EC2 instance on a fleet. In the process, multiple clients interact with
                the main menu UI in order to start and stop matchmaking tickets. If the GameLift matchmaking
                configuration is able to make
                a potential match with the existing active matchmaking requests, a match will be made, and GameLift will
                try to find an available server process to host the game session on. Then, finally, the clients in that
                match will get an update through their matchmaking tickets with the necessary information to connect to
                the server.</p>

            <h2>Client Service</h2>
            <p>Creating the client service in the form of lambda functions and a rest API in Amazon API Gateway. The
                functions in this client service involve making a matchmaking request, cancelling a matchmaking request,
                polling for the status of a matchmaking request, and getting player data. These functions will later be
                used by the client to connect to a game server process hosted on Amazon GameLift</p>

            <p>Creating a FlexMatch matchmaking configuration, attaching a matchmaking rule set to the matchmaker,
                and making an SNS topic for receiving matchmaking event notifications in real time.
                In the process, we also created a DynamoDb table to hold the latest information and status updates
                with regards to matchmaking tickets and requests,
                and subscribed a Lambda function to the SNS topic that writes parts of the messages published
                by FlexMatch to SNS to that table in DynamoDb.</p>
