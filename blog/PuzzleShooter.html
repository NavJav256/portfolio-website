            <h2>Teams</h2>
            <p>Certain enhancements have been introduced to improve gameplay mechanics. Players can now form teams,
                facilitating collaborative efforts during matches. To aid in team identification and coordination,
                unique color schemes have been assigned to each group. Furthermore, measures have been implemented to
                minimize instances of friendly fire, promoting a smoother gameplay experience. Additionally, spawn
                points have been strategically positioned for both teams, ensuring equitable starting positions and
                encouraging strategic maneuvering throughout matches. These adjustments are intended to enrich the
                overall gaming experience by fostering better teamwork and strategy. </p>

            <h2>Lag Compensation Techniques</h2>
            <p>Lag compensation techniques have been integrated to mitigate latency issues, ensuring smoother
                interactions during matches. In particular, client-side prediction has been employed to enhance the
                synchronization of actions such as updating ammo counts, aiming, and reloading animations, providing
                players with a more responsive gaming experience. Additionally, server-side rewind functionality has
                been introduced to validate hits, ensuring the accuracy of combat outcomes. These enhancements aim to
                elevate the overall gaming experience by minimizing disruptions and improving the precision of in-game
                actions.</p>

            <h2>Pickups</h2>
            <p>Players now have access to pickups scattered across the map. Among these are ammo pickups tailored to
                each weapon type, ensuring sustained combat capabilities. Additionally, various buff pickups have been
                introduced, including those for health, shield, speed, and jump boosts, offering strategic advantages
                during matches. Furthermore, players now have the option to equip a secondary weapon, allowing for more
                versatile combat strategies. These updates aim to enrich the gaming experience by providing players with
                additional tactical options and enhancing overall gameplay depth.</p>

            <h2>Different weapon types</h2>
            <p>Players now have access to various weapon types, each offering unique gameplay mechanics. Hit-scan
                weapons have been introduced, allowing for instant targeting and engagement. Additionally,
                projectile-based weapons, such as rocket launchers and grenade launchers, provide tactical advantages
                through their area-of-effect damage. A diverse range of hitscan firearms, including pistols, shotguns
                with scatter effects, and sniper rifles equipped with scopes, further diversify combat strategies.
                Furthermore, grenades have been added to the inventory, featuring dynamic animations to enhance visual
                feedback. To enrich the immersion, reload animations have been meticulously crafted for each weapon,
                contributing to the overall realism and tactical depth of the gameplay experience. </p>

            <h2>Match States</h2>
            <p>Match States now guide players through distinct phases, optimizing gameplay flow. The Warmup phase,
                spanning 30 seconds, allows players to prepare for the upcoming match. During the subsequent Match
                phase, lasting 3 minutes, intense gameplay ensues as players compete for victory. Following this, the
                Cooldown phase provides a brief 30-second interval for reflection before the server shuts down and
                clients go back to the lobby.
                Crucially, times are synchronized between clients and servers, ensuring seamless
                transitions and fair gameplay experiences for all participants. </p>

            <p>WWeapon ammo and carried ammo counts are now tracked, providing players with crucial
                information during engagements. Reload animations have been implemented to provide visual feedback and
                enhance immersion during gameplay. Additionally, combat states have been created to prevent players
                from firing while in the process of reloading, promoting strategic decision-making and adding depth to
                tactical encounters. </p>

            <p>Crosshairs have been integrated to offer visual cues regarding the player's aim, aiding in accurate
                targeting. Notably, these crosshairs are dynamic, adjusting in size based on contextual factors like
                movement or weapon accuracy. Additionally, when aiming a weapon, the screen zooms in, providing players
                with enhanced visibility and finer control over their shots. Furthermore, crosshairs dynamically
                transition to a red hue when hovering over another player, offering immediate visual feedback and
                facilitating quick decision-making in combat scenarios. </p>

            <p>Players can now engage in combat as weapons are now capable of being fired, enhancing the intensity of
                battles. Projectiles have been meticulously configured, ensuring accurate trajectory and impact dynamics
                upon firing. Additionally, firing animations have been established, providing visual feedback and
                enhancing the realism of combat sequences. Moreover, to further immerse players in the action, weapons
                now eject shells upon firing, adding a layer of authenticity to the gameplay experience.</p>

            <h2>Configuring the Client (Unreal Engine)</h2>
            <p>The client makes http requests to the REST API, which has various resources for various AWS Lambda
                functions. The client uses a combination of the responses returned from the API to join an Unreal Engine
                game server process hosted on an EC2 instance on a fleet. In the process, multiple clients interact with
                the main menu UI in order to start and stop matchmaking tickets. If the GameLift matchmaking
                configuration is able to make
                a potential match with the existing active matchmaking requests, a match will be made, and GameLift will
                try to find an available server process to host the game session on. Then, finally, the clients in that
                match will get an update through their matchmaking tickets with the necessary information to connect to
                the server.</p>

                polling for the status of a matchmaking request, and getting player data. These functions will later be

                with regards to matchmaking tickets and requests,
